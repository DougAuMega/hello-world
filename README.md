Hello Earthlings

Doug AuMega Here, I am re-newed to this as I was in a college that showed me more about math than Network Adm. and Security 2004
I quit my job 2 years ago and currently building my work from home. I am seeking to develope my own lite softwares in a few platforms
right now I just want to customize themes on wp for customization. Life from Home beats the hustle and grind of the 6am-6pm construction grind.
Everything Tastes better too.
